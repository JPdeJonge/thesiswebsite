						Als (hobby) muzikant ben ik altijd al geobsedeerd geweest door de kracht van muziek. Over de laatste decennia heeft
						de wereld van muziek zich razendsnel ontwikkeld, en muziek is nu toegankelijk in a kwestie van seconden.
						Mijn passie voor muziek gaat verder dan fan zijn of de melodieën en ritmes, maar omsluit ook alles wat de muziek versterkt.
						 Een van de grootste aantrekkingskrachten in grafisch ontwerp was en is voor mij de wereld van bands met een do-it-yourself
						 mentaliteit en het image wat ze presenteren in een digitale wereld. Zo lang als ik mij kan herinneren heb
						 ik in mijn leven muziek opgezocht, geluisterd en verzameld.
					</p><br />
					<p>
						Vóór de komst van internet richtte de discussie over democratisering van de muziekindustrie zich op het onderscheid
						 tussen doe-het-zelf-labels, onafhankelijke platenlabels en grote platenmaatschappijen. Met het internet en digital
						  streaming platforms zoals Spotify en Apple Music in de 21ste eeuw is het landschap van muziek maken getransformeerd.
							Met een paar klikken vind je suggesties, gecureerde playlists of dat ene obscure nummer waarvan je de vinyl nergens
							meer kon vinden. Hoe hebben streamingdiensten onze relatie met muziek veranderd? Hoe is muziek verandert met de opkomst
							 van streaming diensten? In deze thesis onderzoek ik wat deze veranderingen betekenen voor zowel muzikant als ontwerper.
					</p><br />
					<p>
						Met mijn broer Pim ‘Sebastian Kamae’ de Jonge, 22, als study case, ga ik op zoek naar wat voor rol grafisch ontwerp kan spelen
						 in het promoten van kleinere, professionele muzikanten op digitale platformen. Daarnaast werken we samen aan zijn nieuwe album
						 ‘Enjoy the Ride’ en kijken we wat er komt kijken bij de release van een ontworpen, conceptuele plaat in de praktijk.
					</p><br />
					<p>
						In een zoektocht naar een potentiële niche voor grafisch werk na mijn afstuderen probeer ik in deze thesis een overzicht te
						maken van de verschillende spelers en technieken die er bij de promotie van artiesten op deze platforms komt kijken.
						Het is een poging om tips, tricks en kennis te bundelen en dit toe te passen in het werk dat ik maak en de diensten die ik
						mijn potentiële klanten graag zou willen leveren. Muziek en mijn grafische werk staan me nader aan het hart en ik hoop in deze
						thesis een interessante kijk te bieden op een niche in ons werk als ontwerpers en mijn kennis bij te dragen.
						Ontwerp is de uitnodiging, de muziek het feestje.

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a name="chapter2">The Origins of Chalga</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p>
						Chalga is the Bulgarian version of the Balkan folk music known as Turbo-folk in Serbia, Laiko in Greece,
						Manele in Romania or Tallava in Albania. Musically it strongly resembles oriental music as it uses
						asymmetrical rhythms and certain instruments like accordion or violin. However the visual language rarely
						references directly anything related to Turkey or the Ottoman Empire, belly dancing being the exception.
					</p>
					<p> Historically the Balkans have been influenced greatly by Ottoman rule. Almost five centuries have put a
						mark on the cuisine, music, language and morality because they were forced to adapt to a new unknown culture
						and religion. Therefore the Balkans share many cultural aspects such as pastries like banitsa (burek) or
						wedding rituals which involve some kind of ‘abduction’ of the bride. The musical influence derives from the
						oriental Ottoman Turks and Romani musicians who introduced novel instruments, rhythms and choreography. </p>
					<p>In 1973 the Bulgarian ethnographer Raina Katsarova followed how the song Üsküdara gilder iken (On the way
						to Üsküdar), originally an Ottoman song, spread through the Balkans.<span class="link image-link"> Listening
							to it</span>
						one can easily distinguish the oriental flavour, because of the traditional Turkish lute and style of
						singing. The lyrics tell the story of a woman travelling to Uskudar. On the way there she finds a
						handkerchief, fills it up with turkish delight and shares it with a clerk in her carriage, who she has been
						admiring all along.
					</p>
					<figure class="videoWrapper">
						<video playsinline controls>

						</video>
					</figure>


					<p>Katsarova explored the ‘detailed migration’ of the song through the peninsula, but Buchanan went further to
						examine the significance of the song for each country. Some versions stayed close to the original such as
						the Serbian version Ruse kose curo imaš (Red-haired girl) or the Greek one—Apo xeno topo (From a foreign
						place), where they retell a love story similar to the original. However, the Bulgarian variation Ясен месец
						веч изгрява (A clear moon is already rising) version is much more militant in its content. This demonstrates
						how a song could spread and morph among people who speak different languages but share similar culture.
						Although the origins of the song and its current meaning clash to create a slight irony in Bulgaria. The
						song fuels the resistance against the Ottoman military forces. A very patriotic song about protecting the
						motherland that is currently still the ‘hymn of the Stranzha mountain’. In Adela Peeva’s film Чия е тази
						песен? (Whose is this song?), she asks a group of people if they know where the song’s melody comes from.
						They seem oblivious to its roots and when Peeva reveals ‘They have it in Turkey too!’ a rapid change of mood
						transforms the confused faces from gleeful to furious. These people have gathered to celebrate an uprising
						against the Ottoman oppressors and this woman comes to spoil their illusion. One man is so disappointed by
						her comment, he tells her that he would ‘stone anybody who claims such a historical connection’.

						</figure>

					</p>
					<p>Peeva ends the film asking herself ‘How could one song incite so much hatred?’ This reaction is not
						surprising at all. Folk music is taken seriously in Bulgaria, especially when it recorded the struggle of 5
						centuries of Ottoman subjugation. The identity of the ‘Bulgarian free nation’ has been built by juxtaposing
						the times of suppression with those of freedom. During socialist times, this propaganda against the new
						Republic of Turkey fostered even a stronger national identity. The identity of ‘pure ethnos’, no Turkish or
						Gypsy connections, and ‘pure culture’, no Oriental cultural heritage. Thus it is of no surprise that the
						socialist regime was censoring the level of ‘chalga’ some wedding orchestras exhibited in the 80s. As
						Timothy Rice states ‘Since many wedding instrumentalists were Roma, they played Roma music, especially a
						dance called “kyuchek”’. It was unacceptable to play gypsy music at bulgarian weddings. And to this day
						Gypsies are looked down on when they perform. Or at least until a certain level of sobriety.
					</p>
					<p>Nevertheless, the Soviet Bloc crumbled in 1989 and chalga boomed in popularity. Wedding music left the
						stage to ethno-sound combined with gypsy musical elements, oriental eroticism, pure nonchalance of the ‘free
						spirit’. How could some ‘Bulgarian folk’ music be related to Ottoman or gypsy traditions? Nobody cared. No
						more rules. There were no copyrights, no censorship, people could sing and act however they saw fit.
						Curiously, the music videos did not cross one line. The Ottoman Turkish aesthetic. <span
							class="link image-link">Arab sheiks</span> and camels
						were fine because they were largely oriental, but Ottoman harem and mosques were taking matters too far. In
						fact they are ‘sanitized images’, that are too sensitive for Bulgarian audience and chalga producers
						replaced with Arabic or Western metaphors.

					</p>
					<p>In the article, Bulgarian Chalga on Video: Oriental Stereotypes,
						Mafia Exoticism, and Politics, Vesa Kurkela is examining the place orientalism takes among the audiences
						of
						chalga music. He describes the main variations of the videos like this: ‘The videos also contain
						aggressive
						jokes that display little respect for anyone or anything. The objects of mockery are various—politicians,
						the state administration, the nouveaux riches, the Bulgarian mafia, policemen, macho culture, the sex
						business, Arab sheiks, superficial lovers of fashion, Russian folklore troupes, and various Western
						fashion
						phenomena. Ironic criticism is often so well hidden that the outsider cannot understand it without the
						guidance and explanation of local cultural experts. Nothing in chalga is serious and its contents stray
						very
						far from Western political correctness.’

					</p>
					<p>The post-Socialist period of the 1990s was extremely interesting from social, economical and political
						perspective. People have just been allowed to express themselves, or rather they were not forbidden to do
						so
						it. Years and years of censorship triggered foul language, slutty clothing, large golden crosses
						prominently
						hanging on the chest for whoever could afford it. Thus people not only did not feel any shame but they
						were
						taking pride in showing their vulgarity. Perfect example would be Valdes’s Ribna Fiesta (Fish Fiesta) from
						2001. The video shows a fisherman playing an accordion semi-submerged in a river. From time to time he
						sways
						his fishing rod in a direction we do not see just to be surprised that he does not fish animals but the
						underwear of an attractive woman sunbathing on the shore. If that isn’t enough, he appears entertaining
						his
						friends in a tavern having banknotes stuck to his forehead. Apparently, in 2001 the censorship came back
						because the chorus singing И ловец съм, и рибар съм/ на закона мамата ибал съм (I am a hunter, I am a
						fisherman/ I have fucked the law) which turned into the ‘censored’ version: И ловец съм, и рибар съм/ на
						купона цар и господар съм ( I am a hunter, I am a fisherman/ I am king and master of the party).
					</p>
					<p>Economically, most people struggled to survive and the terrible inflation of 1996 did little good. Dire
						times call for drastic measures as people tried to exchange Bulgarian levs for American dollars or German
						marks at all costs. Thus we can presume that people enjoyed listening to music that echoed their absurd
						lifestyle with humorous spin. Nelina’s Byal Mertsedes (White Mercedes) shows a reality where the
						protagonist
						is sent to buy dollars. Unfortunately, they do not have any left, but she is being followed by a white
						mercedes offering her dollars. She refuses to ‘exchange love for money’.
					</p>
					<p>Certain people figured they can exploit the economic turmoil and organised strong men, usually former
						wrestlers or boxers, to ‘ask company owners to insure their business with them’. Refusal to do so meant
						that
						they will lose their business. This gave rise to the mutri, or mafia, period from 1994 to 1999. They
						acquired loads of money using this ‘business model’ until the 2000s when the explicit violence and
						intimidation waned out. Certain artists were attracted to this and in 1995 Volodya Stoyanov was ‘abducted’
						to sing for Vasil Iliev, mafia boss at the time. Volodya had no choice at first but came to enjoy
						performing
						for him and recorded the album Пирамиди, Фараони (Pyramids, Pharaohs). Later in 1996 Rado Shisharkata and
						Ivan Karachorov–Popa also paid their tribute by recording an absolute classic track, glorifying the mutri
						culture, called Тигре, тигре (Tiger, Tiger). They sing to someone (Vasil Iliev presumably) asking him if
						he
						has money, beautiful women and expensive Western cars or just old women and rusty Soviet cars. Both of
						these
						songs opened the scene for many mutri-songs and chalga became the main choice at most mafia parties.
						Chalga
						was ‘music for the soul’ so politics found no place within it. However, sometimes people appropriated
						songs
						for this purpose. Such is the case with Slavi Trifonov and Ku-ku Band’s Тайсън Кючек (Tajsyn Kyuchek)
						which
						was played at a protest at the end of 1996 firstly in Lom and later in Plovdiv The show Kanaleto, which
						Slavi and Ku-ku Band were part of, openly criticised the prevailing government of Zhan Videnov. Still in
						the
						song, we hear:
						<br>
						<br> Седем-осем и ще си паднала
						<br> Седем-осем и ще си легнала
						<br> Седем-осем лягай и брой си сама
						<br>
						<br> Seven-eight and you will fall
						<br> seven-eight and you will lie down
						<br> seven-eight give up and count yourself
						<br>
						<br>
					</p>
					<p>Presumably there is no political intent, purely the anaphora ‘seven-eight’ refers to boxing knock-out,
						therefore Tajsun is (Mike) Tyson, to imply some threat or taunt. It also refers to kyuchek dance with its
						asymmetric time signature, commonly used in Balkan music. Although nothing suggest political statements,
						protesters used it as a count-down for the ‘last hour’ of the government. Slavi Trifonov entered politics
						more seriously in the last decade. His albums Има такъв народ (There is such a nation) and Песни за
						българи
						(Songs for Bulgarians) are interpretations of folk songs that were supposed to inspire Bulgarians to
						reclaim
						their state. In 2016 Slavi and Ku-ku Band protested against the state at Orlov Most (major bridge in the
						centre of Sofia). Although the songs they performed were much more traditional, he is still known as the
						chalga performer and got a lot of criticism for it. His political motives are dubious, but his chalga
						influence is not. Some were agitated, some were grateful that a resistance to the state has been formed.
						Since then Slavi has moved on to create his own TV channel where he is 'free to go his own way’ and share
						his political views. It is still mainly an entertainment channel, but the censorship is in his hands. So
						perhaps we will see more chalga songs explicitly political.

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a id="chapter3">The Production Evolution</a>
				</h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p>The songs from the 90s and early 2000s have become pure gems within Bulgarian music history. Most people
						today have good memories from this time. People born in the 50s, 60s, 70s were in their prime age when the
						genre evolved. It was loud, energetic, rebellious, sexy, melancholic—it connected to all parts of life, good
						and bad. The children of those people grew up listening to chalga, which in turn brings them good memories.
					</p>
					<p> The music itself was not of the highest quality. The musical instruments were relatively cheap and easy to
						find but second-rate in quality which meant professionals were not satisfied. Soviet-made instruments were
						available, but the difference was miniscule. In-demand were East German keyboards and speakers or third- or
						fourth- hand Fender guitar imported from the West. The sound of those early songs was quite rough, the
						artist being a singer, musician, songwriter and producer. Nobody was taking it too seriously. Most of the
						music was light-hearted, exploring the possibilities. By 1992 two companies—Planeta Payner and Ara
						Music—were founded and have led the industry ever since. They focused on ‘pop-folk’ (the less derogatory
						term for chalga) and produced music, videos, audio cassettes and superstars. Most of the chalga artists
						popular in the 90s until today emerged from one of those two companies. For a couple of years everything
						changed immensely.
					</p>
					<p> Professional songwriters like Nadezhda Zaharieva and Zhivko Kolev wrote many Bulgarian Estrada songs in
						Socialist times and now they were employed again. Were they happy to do that or not, we don’t know yet… The
						content of the songs remained lighthearted but technically they were written with a much better flow and
						rhythm. Perhaps this is one of the reasons these songs are so memorable.
					</p>
					<p>Recording studios and professional sound engineers allowed the artists to acquire top-notch music quality.
						Producers, stylists, make-up artists were responsible to present the artist in the best way. Rarely a song
						would be released without an accompanying music video. For the purpose of the promotion or additional
						profit, chalga videos gained huge success: At the end of the 1990s the new style became an undisputed
						success on the Bulgarian popular music scene. The most popular chalga hits sold more than 100,000 copies,
						whereas domestic rock records could at best reach sales of 10–15,000 copies (Ivo Dochovski and Ventsislav
						Dimov, Interviews, 1999). In the 2000s, the quality continued to grow producing more songs, more videos and
						more stars. Planeta TV was founded in 2001, followed by Planeta Folk TV in 2007 and got an upgrade to HD in
						2010 Early on their artists have joined YouTube and Spotify. One can say that their distribution of content
						is ‘not bad’. Additionally, their Planeta Derby concerts are some of the most visited public venues in the
						country. In general, Planeta Payner has long overshadowed Ara or any other production house, so much to be
						called a ‘mastodon’ by the singer Milko Kalayzhiev.
					</p>
					<p>Retrospective collections are compiled since 2004, preserving the ‘top hits of the industry’. Typically
						these have come to be known as ‘retro chalga’. What defines a song as ‘retro’ is unclear? But it is
						essential to understand that generally these songs are widely accepted and have acquired a much more
						nostalgic status. One comment under the video Kozhena Pola by Dzhesika (Leather Skirt) sums the feeling
						perfectly:

						<br>
						<br> (3) YouTube comment synthesising the general predisposition for chalga
						<br>
						<br> ‘When we get drunk all Bulgarians love retro chalga, regardless of being metalheads, rappers, Eurodance
						fans or whatever other music!’ There are countless comments like this. And it happens outside of the
						internet as well. My brother-in-law is a metalhead can start his casual evening with Two minutes to Midnight
						by Iron Maiden and switch around 2 in the morning to Седем бели коня (Seven White Horses) by Orkestar Oasis.
						When I asked my cousin to talk about chalga she humorously said ‘I don’t listen to the new stuff, only retro
						chalga’.
					</p>
					<p> I wondered what makes the ‘new chalga’ so embarrassing to listen to? When I asked Milko Kalayzhiev, one of
						the most influential artists in the genre, he wasn’t sure but recounted how the Estrada performers were
						deliberately trying to publicly shame chalga. Estrada is a pop genre created during Socialist times as a
						substitute to Western pop. It projected a vision of love, elegance and chivalry, in accordance to certain
						Socialist ideals. By contrast chalga radiated eroticism, hedonism and opulence. The bitter truth, according
						to Milko, however, is that when Estrada fell out of favour, the performers lost their work. It was old,
						sluggish music that exemplified a long-past age. ‘For 30 years they have made a couple of new songs. What do
						you expect from the audience? We produce lots of music. Now we are having a concert with Planeta Payner.
						Wait and see, it will be sold out.’ The concert Milko refers to is the annual concert of Planeta Payner
						where thousands of people show up because it is contemporary, affordable and spectacular. There will be more
						experienced and newly-emerged performers. For 30 years of history, the genre has changed. Now the songs
						sound more ‘pop’ (that is Western pop) and include hip-hop and trap elements. However, the occasional
						clarinet or trumpet solo reminds us it is still Bulgarian music. The artists adapt and their representation
						goes along. If in 2004 Azis caused a scandal with a billboard that stated ‘Азис Как боли’ (Azis How it
						hurts) and showed his nude arse, now the standards have changed. Some artists go much further with how they
						present themselves like Suzanita, daughter of the chalga artist Orhan Murad, who also caused a scandal
						because she dressed so ‘indecently’ despite being only 14. Nevertheless, the ‘scandals’ remind us that this
						is a show-business like any other and attracting attention is just a means to an end.
						<br>
						<br> (4) Azis’s poster Kak boli (How it hurts?) (5) Suzanita’s still from Lucifer i Buda
						<br>
						<br> Nowadays, the general appearance of the chalga artists, after the era of fake boobs and lips, is
						relatively toned down. Looking at a typical billboard with the faces of the evening’s performers, it does
						not diverge from Western pop, Estrada or even rock and metal band aesthetics. Many of the chalga artists
						simply do not need any more scandalous behaviour to be famous due to their reputation or because Planeta
						Payner uses its massive media network to easily promote them.

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a name="chapter4">Enter the Chalga-verse</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<h4>Overarching narrative themes</h4>
					<p>Chalga flourished in the 90s popularised inextricably by its video
						material. Much like MTV in the West, Bulgarian producers realised that music clips were essential to promote
						songs on cable TV, in clubs and cafes. The quality of those videos varied but it took a very short time for
						producers to excel in it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Compared to other Western countries, the era of Bulgarian music video is just beginning. Nevertheless, the
						style of production has changed remarkably during its short history, from amateur one-camera shots to
						sophisticated professionalism. Wrote Vesa Kurkela looking at material from the early 2000s. The production
						quality nowadays is relatively high and it is hard to distinguish from any Western production. Unless, of
						course, we look into the content of the videos.
					</p>
					<p>There are several themes which recurrently appear since the 90s. They are a true reflection of Bulgarian
						needs and desires for opportunity and freedom. For 30 years of democracy materialistic needs haven’t been
						generally satisfied. Chalga is the music that gives a peak into a world of abundant riches, it provides joy
						and excitement, breaks the social reservations with loosely clothed men and women, exposing the innate
						sexual drive of everybody, and covertly clenches to the pillar of religion, with the hope of salvation.
						Those themes are not unique, but perhaps chalga was ahead of its time in many ways. Being provocative,
						satirical and hyperbolising every visual trope, producers market their content to almost every corner of the
						country and even beyond.
					</p>
					<p>Mafia-baroque or Mutro-baroque is a set of aesthetic qualities that the Bulgarian mafia has acquired in the
						90s. ‘Many Bulgarians often consider chalga the music of the new economic elite—the nouveaux riches.’ in the
						90s but it is fairly applicable even in 2019. The relationship with money has always been problematic to me.
						Bulgarian society is entranced by the idea of being rich, influenced by the rose-tinted vision of the
						Western life and technically free to achieve anything with no political oppressions. (6) Georgi Iliev
						drinking with friends (7) A Room in Mutro-baroque style In Sashka Vaseva’s highly experimental music video
						Левовете в марки (Levs in Marks) the story revolves around a woman who is looking for a company to have a
						drink with. She needs to exchange Bulgarian levs for German marks in order to buy alcohol. What a hard task.
						It just shows how hard it was to do anything in the years of inflation of 1995-1996 with devalued currency.
						It is even more simple with Kondyo’s Мъни, мъни (Money, money) where the singer sheds light on the secret of
						life: money. That’s what women want, if you have money, everybody loves you, and if you don’t–everybody is
						gone!
					</p>
					<p>Around this time extremely popular was travelling to Turkey to buy Western goods and smuggle them in
						Bulgaria in order to make money. If you already had foreign currency and managed to buy cigarettes and jeans
						from there, you still had to bring it back into the country. In the song Митничарю (Border guard) by Lia we
						witness all the trouble she has to go through in order to smuggle her cargo. She is stopped at the border,
						so the guards can check thoroughly the car. Lia hopes she can easily go through, calls her mother for
						support and begs the guards. The voice of reason joins her mental process to suggest giving the guards 200
						marks. At the end 'they are also people/ they need some for cigarettes and some to build a house'.
					</p>
					<p> Nowadays there are fewer songs specifically about money, but it has stayed a leitmotif nevertheless. In
						2013 song За Пари (About money) by Galena no currency is mentioned because it makes no difference. The
						protagonist is singing about the power and allure of money. She is talking to a beautiful strong man whom
						she advises that talking ‘about money’ is all he needs. Simply ‘For money, for money, you speak/ this word
						women love even more than sex’. More recently, another view on the importance of money emerged. In the 2019
						song of Emilia and Denis Teofikov Акула (Shark) we observe two plot lines. Denis is a young lad, whose life
						is ordinary. He sings ‘I don’t come back with a Mazeratti, I am not from a family of aristocrats’. His
						girlfriend in the beginning confesses her friends are making fun of her because she rides in his decrepit
						car. On the other hand, Emilia is the lover of a misogynistic thug, who has given her everything but love
						and care. She runs away only to come back and nearly assassinate him. In another song Тръгвай си (Go away)
						of the same duo, we finally learn that Emilia is ready to give all her wealth away for her true love: ‘A
						life with expensive cars and wealth/ I make God cry again tonight/ since I saw you/ I have nothing, if I
						don’t have you, I understood’
					</p>
					<p> Nevertheless, most songs still abundantly show wealth to the audience. Prominent in the clothes of the
						singers and actors, their cars, yachts or planes and the locations the events unravel. A good example is Не
						ме оставяй (Don’t leave me) by Fiki and Tsvetelina Yaneva. The video radiates wealth and money to a
						microscopic level. We witness a long, pan view of the mansion the video is shot, the elaborate architecture
						and exotic furniture, all the adorned objects inside ending with a fabulous appearance of the slow-motion
						gait of Fiki and the flowing silky dress of Tsvetelina. To acquire wealth is a goal of many, however some
						see it only as a way to enjoy oneself. Music on the Balkans has a great tradition of joyful tavern
						performance at least since the inter-war period, where people eat, drink and sing along. Valdes’s Рибна
						Фиеста (Fish Fiesta) besides being vulgar and provocative, it shows the performer entertaining his guests
						and friends at a table, where they drink, laugh and enjoy the music. Another classic track is Шопската
						салата (The Shopska Salad) by Rado Shisharkata which is simply dedicated to the Shopska Salad, summer salad
						from tomatoes, cucumbers, spring onion and cheese. It commemorates the little joys in the singer’s life like
						the salad, the alcohol mastika, blonde girls and his desire to spend all his heaps of money at the seaside,
						where he can lie on the beach with his loved one under the stars. Additional aspect of this hedonism is
						excitement which can be more clearly be heard in the Нещо нетипично (Something untypical) by Ivana. There
						the singer is done with all the cliches of modern life and yearns an exciting, wild night out. The very
						first verse is an imperative ‘Why don’t we get drunk/ let’s break all the foolish cliches/ let’s get wild
						tonight’. Her appeal for more excitement, an escape from the boring daily life resonates greatly with many
						people who miss something in their lives.
					</p>
					<p>In the past years, joyful songs have continued to emerge. In 2015 Galena released Стара каравана (Old
						Caravan) where she paints a peaceful picture of her perfect summer experience. She stays in an old caravan
						at the beach with her friends drinking, singing and enjoying the beautiful summer months. There is no real
						mention of anything material, but a general enjoyment is emphasised.

					</p>
					<br>
					<p>The most characteristic quality of chalga is its eroticism and love problematics. As we have already
						established, gypsy culture has a tremendous effect on the chalga music and aesthetics. The belly-dance in
						particular is an erotic element that has transformed and it relies more on the scantily-clad female sex
						symbols. Historically, Bulgaria never had belly-dancing as it was popular in Arabia usually performed by
						minority groups like the gypsies. This eroticism, however, has proven to be a fantastic marketing tool that
						gypsies have nothing to do with. In the 90s, dancers shook their bodies alongside singers on the stage but
						with the advance of cable TV this kind of imagery has totally exploded. To a western person, this may seem
						as too much provocation from a music video.
					</p>
					<p> Most music videos in the beginning included lots of Arabic themes where the proverbial belly dancer is
						capturing our eye. She moves with the rhythm and we gape at her, mentally caressing her flexible body.
						Appropriating the dance, she has mainly an erotic purpose, usually leading to a very tragic performance. On
						many occаsions, for example in Milko Kalayzdhiev turbo classic song Къде си батко (Where are you, big
						brother?), the idea for harem, where a man is surrounded by beautiful playful women, is very prominent. And
						besides, the themes of the videos, the average look of the female singers is absolutely stunning as they
						have the most fabulous hairstyles, make-up and body figures. In 1996 Mitko Dimitrov the owner of Payner
						explained that ‘good look’ is essential for success and if a singer is not so good-looking they use pin-up
						girls for the cassette covers. Nowadays, eroticism holds the same importance, the only difference being more
						contemporary in fashion.
					</p>
					<p>As most pop songs, however, chalga revolves around love and all its subsidiery themes: heartbreak,
						infidelity, sex. And this is the big power of chalga: its lyrics. Many people attack the laid-back shallow
						songs, which are meant to be summer hits and nothing more. They give folk songs like Земи огин, запали ме
						(Take this fire, burn me) as an example. It praises a woman whom the protagonist is waiting to be with and
						the latter about a man who cannot live his life anymore chasing this woman, so she better set him on fire
						and end his misery. Loads of folk ballads celebrate the love between people. Even more so, this interest
						exists for a long time in literature, a good example being the story about the princess in Kosachi
						(Scythemen) by Elin Pelin. One of the characters describes the seductive love of the princess being fatal to
						her lovers, but the tale itself captivates the listeners and it makes them ponder on their romantic lives.
						Other comparisons is made with the passionate tracks by Lili Ivanova or Emil Dimitrov, some of the Estrada
						singers from Socialist times. And even with Stari gradski pesni (Old-city songs) that became popular in the
						inter-war period.
					</p>
					<p>All of those stories sprang up from times of moral censorship and chivalry. Chalga, also holds a few very
						intimate songs, which can hardly be accused of profanity. Богиньо моя (My goddess) by Maksim is a deeply
						sentimental ballad telling the story of someone who sings only about his ‘goddess’ and will do anything to
						win her heart. Another other great classic ballad, from a female perspective, is Погледни ме в очите (Look
						me in the eyes) by Aneliya where love is portrayed as something ultimate where no lies, no pain or anger
						will change it.

					</p>
					<br>
					<p>Finally, a side of chalga that is somehow obscured is its political power. In the 90s Valdes and Slavi
						Trifonov said what they wanted with their music as already mentioned: Рибна фиеста (Fish fiesta) and Тайсън
						Кючек (Tajsun Kyuchek) respectively. At that time the Bulgarian punk movement also developed strongly, other
						rock and metal bands stated their opinions. In general, the last decade of the 20th century had a lot to
						unpack. With the turn of the century, there were other players in the game. The Hip-Hop groups like Ъпсърт
						(Upsurt) and Спенс (Spens) were very political. However, in the 21st century chalga music and producers are
						becoming more and more intertwined with secular authority. Before every election there are public concerts
						paid by political parties and as the politicians need to reach the most people, chalga is the logical
						choice. Of course this does not mean that chalga singers are associated directly with the commissioners'
						political orientation. Public opinion is that most of the mafia members from the 90s are now in the
						political circles and if you remember some chalga singers glorified the mafia at the time. Thus, now they
						cannot criticise and ridicule the government where their old acquaintances are.
					</p>

					<h4>Visual language as a device for marketing</h4>
					<p>The aesthetics of chalga videos are anything but boring.
						Since their genesis they have followed the Western process of production. In the 90s, the typical formula
						was the MTV video. There were 3 types of clips—documentation of concerts or performances, narrative videos
						and music-based videos. Documentation were and still are very common amongst more traditional folklore
						videos of the singer, usually accompanied by the orchestra, in a ‘traditional setting’ full of rugs, pottery
						in a generic 19th century house. Older performances of Toni Dacheva’s Сладка работа (Sweet job) or Kondyo’s
						Доко Доко (Doko Doko) give perfectly accurate impression, as well as any video on Planeta Folk TV, Tyankov
						TV or Rodina TV which position their singers in backyards, taverns and rocks on a river bank.
					</p>
					<p>Narrative videos have linear plots, without much depth, depicting a simple story line based on the lyrics,
						which the viewer can follow. In the video of Rumyana Ало, такси (‘Allo, taxi) we observe the singer who
						wants to reach the seaside hitchhiking. She gets into a taxi, Mercedes, almost ends up in an old Trabant,
						and finally she rides in a Golf. The last one she sings about is a BMW, but we see a Volkswagen.
						Unfortunately, we’ll never know what happened there. The narrative simply reflects the lyrics, showing a
						young woman using her charm to get to the beach. Through the years, the production quality of the clips have
						drastically improved, but the depth of the story not much. A video like Нула време (Zero time) by Milko
						Kalaydzhiev is full of expensive cars and airplanes, shot with high quality cameras and drones but it
						doesn’t add too much to the song. Milko wants forgiveness from his lover because he made a mistake, she
						wants to kill him but ultimately they reconcile. The pictures live in their own universe showing the woman
						getting frustrated with her phone, being with other men or just striding on an abandoned airplane runway
						with a shotgun on her shoulder.
					</p>
					<p> Sometimes videos break totally free from the lyrics of the singer and build their own world. The
						aforementioned Левовете в марки (Levs in marks) by Sashka Vaseva is exemplary of absolute visual freedom.
						Sashka is singing about drinking and money exchange but the video is exploring its own universe. The techno
						rhythms combined with MIDI violins provide an excellent playground for all kinds of dancing silhouettes,
						double exposures with fire and erotic close-ups of female and male bodies. Tsvetelina Yaneva’s 2019 song
						Ангелът (The angel) is about a love drama that killed the angel in her… However, the clip is not dramatising
						this instead it takes a marvellously colourful vaporwave, neo-cyberpunk that is abstract and open to
						interpretation.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p> At the end, the visual language of chalga is more than the sum of its parts. In isolation, chalga is
						pop-music and the tropes it uses can be applied to Western, Latin American or East Asian music. But the mix
						of new technology, provocative performances, exuberant make-up and jewellery with traditional landscapes and
						taverns or expensive cars and hotels creates a unique phenomenon.

				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a name="chapter5">Inferior Complexity of National Identity</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p>
						In the beginning of the 20th century the Bulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov tells the story of Bai Ganio
						who is a ‘typical Bulgarian character’. With his sharp trading mind and fabulously bushy moustache he
						departs to Vienna to explore the Western world, share the Bulgarian culture and earn some money on the side
						by selling rose oil. Unfortunately, he does not represent the country that well as he exposes his Balkan
						manners a few times, such as shouting on the streets of Vienna or bringing his trading bags in the public
						bathroom because he does not trust anybody. Bai Ganio is not a terrible man, but he is a collective
						character for all negative Bulgarian traits like profanity, egocentrism, hedonism and greed. He was created
						to remind the people that one should behave in a society with different ideals and culture and leave the
						Orientalist backward-thinking behind. Perhaps it worked too well now, because one is disgraced when accused
						of manifesting any of these traits, traits that chalga easily exemplifies.
					</p>
					<p>Shame is very interesting as a psychological phenomenon because it needs an external viewer. In contrast to
						guilt that is internal and concerns the action, e.g. murder, that has been done, shame is pointed at the
						doer and their moral values, e.g. being disrespecful to war heroes. Nevertheless, there are actions that are
						classified as ‘bringing shame’. In his book Musical Concerns, Jerrold Levinson points out that ‘ashamed’ is
						one of them. Another one is ‘shameful’. A shameful musical taste is when you like music people generally
						find repulsive. Would the opposite be positive? Shameful → shameless? No, it is also a negative adjective.
						So it seems as soon as something is labeled as shameful it is hard to reverse it. Chalga music, in all its
						forms, has been criticised by people in the 19th, 20th and 21st century. It has survived for 3 centuries,
						developing, adapting, reflecting the world around us, but it hasn’t disappeared. And the arguments against
						it have always been the same: too vulgar, too erotic, not ‘traditional’ enough.

					</p>
					<br>
					<p>But if it reflects the reality, how come it is shameful? Reality cannot be so repulsive, but the perception
						of it can be. ‘Chalga’ is not only a type of music there are also ‘chalga politicians’, ‘chalga historians’,
						‘chalga culture’. All phrases that denote poor-quality variations of the listed terms. And moreover, people
						talk about ‘spiritual emigration’ which is a result of ‘chalgization’ of the whole nation. So is Bulgaria
						chalgagized?
					</p>
					<p>National identity is a puzzling construct, because of two subjugations that lasted centuries. The first by
						the Byzantine Empire for almost 2 centuries and second by the Ottoman Empire for 5 centuries. The latter
						being so long, that almost assimilated the native culture and traditions. After the liberation in 1878,
						Bulgaria suddenly had to respond to Europe . At the time the ‘elite’ was already identifying with other
						cultures trying to reject everything Ottoman or traditionally Bulgarian. In the influential novel
						Криворазбраната цивилизация (The Phoney Civilization) Dobri Voynikov depicts the Bulgarian reality as full
						of shame from traditional values and imitation of everything French and Austrian. In a way this is a
						reaction to the simplicity and coarseness of Bai Ganio, as much as a desire for a more prosperous life. It
						also lurks as a longing for a fargone glory, when the Second Bulgarian Kingdom had spanned over the Balkan
						peninsula. After breaking from the Ottoman rule, Bulgaria felt under-developed, inadequate in the new
						European context. A sense of inferiority was kindled. Georgi Hadzhyiski defines 3 symptoms of this complex:
						– A feeling of shame, because every textbook teaches the historical misfortune the nation has endured with
						many subjugations, slaughter and plunder. – A feeling of guilt, caused by the occasions when strong leaders
						were betrayed and the disillusionment that nobody may ever again resemble heroic figures from history books
						and folk stories. – A megalomaniac tendencies, aiming to amend those feelings by twisting reality and
						exaggerating every facet of Bulgarian society, e.g. its uniqueness, strength, intelligence and innate
						decency and humility.

					</p>
					<br>
					<p>Megalomania usually uses historical and geographical facts to support its intentions. In 1762, Paisii
						Hilendarski finished the book История Славянобългaрска (Slavonic-Bulgarian History) where he fitted numerous
						examples of the great history of the Bulgarian nation. A substantial work which inspired several liberation
						movements. It becomes problematic, however, when the beating in the chest goes out of hand. When Paisii
						Hilendarski compiled his ‘history’ he picked only the relevant heroic examples of Bulgarian history and left
						out many not so interesting in order to prove his point. His text is not a historical account, but more of a
						literary artwork. Of course, it did not include any accounts of the Ottoman rule. I reckon that 300 years
						later this attitude has backfired. And when chalga brought any allusions to the Orient (not Ottoman, but
						close enough), it hit right in the heart of many. Today, however, with much more refined historical
						knowledge the Bulgarian nation can build a more grounded approach in order to position itself in the
						European Union with a solemn acceptance of its disreputable past.
					</p>
					<p>Several hundreds years later in 1981, a celebration was held for 1300 years since the founding of the
						state. I imagine that rudimentary questions of identity arose: What is our ethnos? Where do we come from?
						What are our traditions? Great monuments were built, films were produced and opulent events were organised
						solely to commemorate the occasion. Furthermore, Socialism brought more than fake confidence in our history,
						it also introduced socialist values, introduced by the ‘communist morality’. These are practically positive
						and negative character traits that a citizen should consider. Unity, patriotism, honesty, discipline,
						hard-work are prefered over individualism, hedonism, laziness and disloyalty. Obviously, chalga checks all
						the boxes of traits one would avoid. It is easy then to label it ‘the bottom of culture’, disregarding its
						origins and methods of expression. During those times, however, this morality was a guiding principle and
						also an unreachable utopia. Nobody, even the party members, were not diligent enough to satisfy the
						Communist Morality. Nowadays, the reservations around chalga are theoretical and come up in conversations
						but in reality chalga clubs are full, chalga singers are constantly booked for events and chalga YouTube
						videos gain millions of views.
					</p>
					<p> When democracy came in 1989, Bulgaria could go with whomever it wants. It could go East to Russia or West
						to Europe and the US. The change started slowly though. Ex-Yugoslavia was technically West and it has always
						seemed as the great middle ground between harsh capitalism and utopian communism, with their private
						property and openness to Western culture. Many people enjoyed Serbian music because it appeared ‘fresher and
						more honest, closer to the soul’. They understood folk traditions but it seemed like a music for another
						time. The constructed image of the Bulgarian hard-working citizen was hard to keep up-to-date. New times
						have come. Folk music was too reminiscent of the peasant lifestyle and became shameful. At this time ‘being
						Balkan’ was yet another step to the magnificent West.
					</p>
					<p>Turbo-folk lost its lustre after a few years and by the end of the century, questions arose again of what
						is the true Bulgaria identity and music to reflect it. Nobody relied on truck drivers to smuggle VHS tapes
						and cassettes from Serbia or Turkey. There was cable TV, internet, radio, people were coming back with
						magical stories of the great America. In the 2000s Bulgarian hip-hop culture formed, new age band appeared
						and pop music that is not chalga started to gain speed. After the euphoria of the 90s, it was hard to accept
						what chalga really represents. It was more and more attacked for its lighthearted nature and striking
						aesthetics and perhaps people had enough of it. It is unclear, but every decade it adapts and people
						continue to shamelessly and shamefully listen to its pumping rhythm.
					</p>

			<div class="chapter chapter-6">
				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a name="chapter6">On Accepting Chalga</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p>The controversial status of chalga provides a multi-angle view by the audience. The artists were showering
						in fame and acknowledgement, the majority of Bulgarians enjoyed listening to the music. My parents’
						generation let their children listen freely to the music and many aspired to become the next superstars.
						Ex-Yugoslavian, Greek and Romanian music was intertwining with chalga and a peculiar Balkan musical exchange
						formed. The intellectuals were closely following its development and it even intrigued many American and
						Balkan researchers to deeply analyse the phenomenon. And to this day the discourse around chalga is layered
						and complicated because it concerns the ‘democratic period’ with all its turbulent political and cultural
						transitions. What we need, however, is to leave emotions aside and appreciate the awareness and criticism
						the music holds.
					</p>
					<p>Asking chalga singers whether they like chalga or not is redundant. But perhaps it is not a matter of
						‘liking’. Milko Kalayzdhiev explained that chalga naturally grew from what was already there. In the 80s
						wedding music was very popular, but with the introduction of Yugoslavian turbo-folk cassettes smuggled by
						truck drivers, it died out. Turbo-folk was the new fad. Milko stopped playing music and started DJ-ing.
						Eventually, he wanted to produce his own music and he just jumped into it without having any idea how to do
						it. This was 1994, today he still releases new songs. His song Хей, Малката (Hey, you, the little one) is a
						classic track that transcended Bulgarian frontiers into Albania and Macedonia. Some artists perform some
						folk songs or jazz and dance So as many other artists, they are not absolutely confined to chalga, they have
						just found their groove. Would the fans stop listening if there are no more chalga songs produced? Would the
						artists follow the taste of the audience? It is tricky to say.
					</p>
					<p>Most of the papers already written on chalga observes from a distance the industry and its fans. I felt it
						is irrelevant to talk about pop music without considering the audience Therefore, I wanted to hear what they
						think. We are not sure who listens to chalga. Stupid people? Uneducated people? Gypsy people? Is this true?
						In a small research article Kapital newspaper interviewed young adults who were highly educated and didn’t
						listen to chalga at home, but enjoyed some ’easy-going, music for the soul’ in the club. Sometimes people
						say ‘I don’t listen to chalga!’ which probably means that they do. Actually it definitely means they do but
						they conceal it due to the nationwide shame and prejudices associated with the community. Allegedly, chalga
						entices about 50% of Bulgarians, followed by 19% pop, 14% rock, etc. But classifying people as fans of only
						one specific genre of music is absurd. And sometimes people like my sister’s husband would fool themselves
						into thinking that their favourite 90s ballad is not chalga. The truth is chalga songs get millions of views
						on YouTube, chalga clubs are always full and chalga accompanies every party. Concerts abroad also attract a
						lot of visitors. Shows in the US, Canada, England or the Netherlands get many Bulgarians together and their
						hearts are stricken with loads of emotions of familiarity and saudade. Outside of Bulgaria, nobody cares
						what music we listen to. Foreigners consider it oriental, so they might think of us as oriental people. So
						what? If they dislike Arab immigrants, they probably dislike Eastern Europeans. Ultimately it makes no
						difference. Chalga is the most popular music genre in Bulgaria that is developing with the zeitgeist and we
						identify with it, especially when we are surrounded by a culture so different from ours in Western Europe or
						North America.
					</p>
					<p>Other Balkan people seemingly perceive this type of music differently. One Albanian friend of mine was
						always talking about ‘Balkan traditions’ to amplify the sense of belonging and sameness of the peninsula.
						Our food, our culture, music, visual aesthetics, mentality, moral values: they come pretty close. A Serbian
						art student from Niš made an iconic representation of Ceca, the Serbian pop queen, to capture the respect
						people have for her. She transcended being a mere mortal, she became a saint. Her wedding in the 90s with
						the military leader Arkan was an extraordinary event and many of her songs are listened to even today. (8)
						Turbo-folk icon Ceca as an Orthodox Icon (9) Ceca and Arkan’s wedding procession That is not to say that all
						Serbians are proud of turbo-folk and they share it with everybody but there is a discussion around it. In
						the 90s, some youngsters saw turbo-folk as the music of the peasants. People with low culture, simple needs,
						financially deprived who moved to the city and brought the simplicity with them. The underground scene
						escaped this reality through hip-hop and techno. Nowadays, however, times have changed. What used to be
						music reflecting the insecurity and injustice of the 90s, have transformed into a scar reminding people what
						they have heroically endured. Thus the charge of turbo-folk is completely relieved from this pain and people
						nostalgically celebrate their youth with the most memorable tracks.
					</p>
					<p>In Bulgaria thankfully, younger generations (Mila Robert and Goro) slowly begin to stray away from being
						ashamed and instead experiment and provoke by positioning it as classical tracks, making cover versions or
						injecting it in-between techno tracks. The Bulgarian intelligentsia, however, has retreated from the field.
						They have grown to discuss only very specific areas of society in the Socialist period. There wasn’t much
						alternative culture at the time anyways. When chalga was developing some of them showed interest and shared
						their opinions. People like Rosmary Statelova, Kler Levi, Ventsislav Dimov have genuinely been interested in
						the topic and until this day they produce objective and accurate analyses. Kler Levi talks about ‘the
						syndrome of the curled eyebrow’ which is an indicator of the contempt that some academics have against
						chalga. Her article was seminal because it shifted the initial problematics of ‘For or against chalga’ to
						‘What is chalga and what does it mean for the Bulgarian society?’. In the 2000s with the advance of online
						blogs and small publications many philosophers, journalist and parvenues have shared their disgust with
						chalga music and industry without contributing much to the discourse. In recent years there are many
						negative news articles analysing chalga and few real in-depth overviews I was not surprised when Martin
						Karbovsky rejected my request to interview him. Humorously when asked ‘Would you share your reservations for
						discussing chalga?’ he answered laconically ‘No.’ The reluctance to delve into analysis nowadays is
						understandable: chalga is publicly shamed, considered low culture and some sort of unpatriotic phenomenon.
						Moreover, it seems that they see no point to discuss and instead just wait for it to die out.

			<div class="chapter chapter-7">
				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a name="chapter7">Conclusion</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p>
						Chalga is not dying. It was born naturally from the frustration and celebration of the Balkan person, who
						desires to belong to a community. Whether this is a community of post-Soviet countries, post-Ottoman states
						or European nations, Bulgaria wanted to enter a new age. Chalga is not a symptom or a cause for the
						political, economic or cultural situation. Chalga is a consequence, it is a device to cope with struggle and
						identity formation. The music was born by centuries of culture-blending and social uproar. The Ottoman rule
						is a highly sensitive topic, anything that can be connected to it is dangerous. Nevertheless, it is also
						absurd to deny all, which relates to 500 years of history. The Socialist faux identity of ‘the pure nation’
						created only misknowledge and infected the Bulgarian society with shame of its roots and environment. This
						remorse always baffled me and I hoped I can partly heal it by delving into chalga. By defining where chalga
						comes from, what it reflects and why it is so widely criticised. Hopefully, we can come to terms with our
						past and understand our present without shame or guilt. Only then we can start changing our society
						according to our circumstances, abilities and needs.

			<div class="chapter chapter-8">
				<h3 class="title chapter-title"><a name="chapter8">Methodology / Afterword</a></h3>
				<div class="chapter-body">
					<p>
						I didn’t understand chalga or the people who listened to it. But the controversy around it always intrigued
						me. I understood it is about aesthetics and morals, but did not connect politics or identity with it. The
						very first time I thought about any connection was when I listened to Valdes’ Рибна фиеста (Fish Fiesta).
						The moment when he sings about ‘fucking the law’ sparked a link. A link to the stereotypical Bulgarian macho
						who always knows how to trick the system. And I started listening to more and more songs and to find small
						bits of information that reflected a piece of history. Sharing this with friends and strangers I was always
						greeted with the same look— ‘the syndrome of the raised eyebrow’ — because they thought I was satirical.
						Almost always, however, they agreed with me when I gave them a few examples. ‘But today it is only crap...’
						they continued when we brought the discussion to current times. I found this so weird: to be so incredibly
						close-minded and deeply affected by one music genre.
					</p>
					<p>When I started writing, I still got the ‘raised eyebrow’ and a lot of my friends disagree with me. But most
						of them are also intrigued to read a piece of writing on a topic they have always considered unworthy to
						explore. I did not know why I am writing about it, but during the research what kept me going was the
						constant paradoxes that emerged. A paradox that people fill the clubs, but the deny listening to it. A
						paradox that it is something so Bulgarian and yet many are ashamed of it. Recently, the new song of Zarko 52
						ле'а разходи (52 leva costs) was featured in several TV broadcasts and web newsletters as a song which
						‘actually mocks the Bulgarian reality with a tinge of Balkan rhythms. After writing about ‘reflection of
						Bulgarian society through chalga’ for several months, this is rather comical and it creates another paradox.
						A paradox that people accept chalga when somebody ridicules the genre. But in its essence chalga ridicules
						Bulgarian society. Are they mocking a ridicule?
					</p>
					<p>Being a sensitive topic, I wanted to explore many points of view. And I got this wider angle by reading
						appropriate literature, interviewing many different people and rummaging through social media just so I can
						understand what comprises this phenomenon. I hope that this research provides a clear understanding of
						chalga and opens the gateway to new works. Strong artworks, music tracks and academic research could deter
						people from focussing on useless discussions of whether chalga is good or not because it is here and it is
						not going anywhere.
